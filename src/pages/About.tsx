        <h1>Welcome to Yummy Planner!</h1>
        At Yummy Planner, we are driven by a simple belief: everyone deserves
        access to great food that's both affordable and easy to prepare.
        Launched in 2023, we offer a unique solution for food lovers of all
        backgrounds, from college students on tight budgets to busy parents
        needing quick meal ideas, and everyone in between.
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        It all started in a cozy kitchen with two friends who loved to cook but
        were dismayed by the costly recipe books and pricey online
        subscriptions. They wondered, "Why should delicious, diverse meals be
        expensive or difficult to access?" From this question, Yummy Planner was
        born, transforming the way recipes are enjoyed by offering them at just
        25 cents each.
